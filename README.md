# PRODIGY_DS_02 - Titanic EDA

## Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

### 📊 Project Overview
This project involves performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset as part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns and relationships in passenger data to understand survival factors.

### 🎯 Objective
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Explore relationships between variables
- Identify patterns and trends in passenger survival
- Create insightful visualizations

### 🔍 Key Insights Discovered
- **Gender Impact**: Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males
- **Class Mattered**: 1st class passengers were more likely to survive
- **Age Factor**: Children and elderly passengers had better survival chances
- **Fare Correlation**: Higher fare-paying passengers had better survival rates

### 📈 Visualizations Created
- Survival count by gender
- Survival count by passenger class
- Age distribution by survival status
- Fare distribution by survival status
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
